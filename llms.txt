# Headless Wheel Builder

> Universal, headless Python wheel builder with GitHub operations and CI/CD automation

## Overview

Headless Wheel Builder (hwb) builds Python wheels from anywhere — local paths, git URLs, tarballs — with integrated release management, dependency analysis, and full CI/CD pipeline orchestration. All without touching the web UI.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install headless-wheel-builder

# Build from current directory
hwb build

# Build from git repository
hwb build https://github.com/user/repo

# Build specific version with Docker
hwb build https://github.com/user/repo@v2.0.0 --isolation docker
```

## Core Commands

### hwb build
Build Python wheels.
- Source: Local path, git URL (with @branch/@tag), or tarball
- `--isolation`: venv (uv-powered) or docker (manylinux/musllinux)
- `--python`: Target Python versions (3.10-3.14)
- Returns: Built wheel paths

### hwb release create
Create draft releases with approval workflows.
- `--workflow`: simple, two-stage, or enterprise
- `--changelog`: Auto-generate from Conventional Commits
- Returns: Release ID, approval status

### hwb release approve
Approve and publish releases.
- `--stage`: QA, security, release (enterprise workflow)
- Returns: Publication status

### hwb deps graph
Analyze dependency trees.
- `--format`: tree, json, dot, mermaid
- `--check-licenses`: Flag GPL in permissive projects
- Returns: Dependency graph, license report

### hwb pipeline run
Execute build-to-release pipelines.
- `--stages`: build, test, release, publish
- Returns: Pipeline status, artifacts

### hwb gh release
Headless GitHub release management.
- `create`, `list`, `download`, `delete` subcommands
- Returns: Release metadata, asset URLs
